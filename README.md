This project contains tools to help with proposed spelling
simplifications for French :

- a [browser extension](extension/README.md), to browse the web with
the adjusted spelling
- a WIP [website](https://ortografe-server.fly.dev/), to transcribe text
and documents interactively without installing anything. [Source](site/).
- a [program](doc-conversion/) that transcribes the text of documents
  in various formats (pure text, html, xhtml, .doc, .docx, .epub).

We may add more tools in the future.
