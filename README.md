This project contains tools to help with proposed spelling
simplifications for French :

- a [browser extension](extension/README.md), to browse the web with
the adjusted spelling
- a [website](https://v-gb.github.io/orthographe/), to transcribe text
interactively without installing anything. [Source html](index.html).

We may add more tools in the future.
