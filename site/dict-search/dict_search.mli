(** A module that implements approximate dictionary search.

    Specifically, given a request "nec" :
    - it returns words that starts with that request, like "nectar",
      including with diacritics like "nÃ©cessaire"
    - if the query contains diacritics, then completions will only
      contain words that respect such diacritics
    - it returns the shortest completions first
    - it doesn't return duplicate entries if the both words match
    - Å“ is treated as oe
    - it's quick (20us to 400us kind of numbers)
